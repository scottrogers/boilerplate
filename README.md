# boilerplate #

This is a boilerplate template for your public files.

- Compiles CoffeeScript to JS.
- Compliles LESS to CSS.

The CoffeeScript files start you off with some base classes to extend from. As well
as other helper functions I have found to be useful overtime.

The LESS files contain config, typography and other base definitions.

CSS Files are imported from public/css onto the index page.
